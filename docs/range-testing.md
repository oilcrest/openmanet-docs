# Wi-Fi HaLow Range Testing — Pulpit Rock, Colorado Springs

This round of testing went pretty well overall. The setup was running on a **2 MHz channel (42 @ 923 MHz)** with just **two nodes** in the 802.11s mesh. Speeds were tested using the Google Speed Test app on my iPhone (should’ve used `iperf3`—next time).  

- **Local test (within 15 ft):** 4.03 / 4.27 Mbps  
- **With a 3rd node added:** 2.00 / 4.06 Mbps  

The **Starlink and Mesh Gateway** were staged on top of **Pulpit Rock** in Colorado Springs, with tests conducted at different spots around the rock. All tests used a **Muzi Works whip antenna**. I planned to compare another antenna but forgot them at home.  

Next round of testing will be with **multiple nodes** and on **1, 4, and 8 MHz channels**. When testing locally at 8 MHz, I hit **~15 Mbps**, so it’ll be interesting to see how that holds up at distance.

> Note: Recent OpenMANET firmware improves automatic GPSd configuration on Seeed-based nodes, which makes long-running range tests more “plug and play”.
